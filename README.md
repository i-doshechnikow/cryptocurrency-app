#Cryptocurrency App

The project is available at the following link https://cryptohelper.netlify.app - go for a detailed review of the project.

This is a project demonstrating the world of cryptocurrencies, there are top 10 most popular cryptocurrencies, global statistics, and the latest news on the main page. You can click on the cryptocurrency for detailed information, or on the news to go to it.

When you go to the Cryptocurrencies page, the 100 most popular currencies are shown, and the search works by name and by currency abbreviation. When you go to the - News page, 18 of the latest news from the world of cryptocurrencies are shown, there is a drop-down selector that allows you to sort the news by the name of the coin.

In this project I used these technologies: React, React Router Dom, Redux Toolkit, Ant Design, and some others. 

Below are some screenshots and GIFs showing some of the SPA features.
